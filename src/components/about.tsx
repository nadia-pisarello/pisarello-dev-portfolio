            My journey in tech began thanks to my sister, and since then, Iâ€™ve
            been fascinated by how ideas can be brought to life through
            functional and engaging interfaces.

            My personal mantra is: "Gratitude enriches, complaining
            impoverishes". I believe curiosity, humility, and a good attitude
            make all the difference in this ever-evolving world.

            I mainly work with technologies like NestJS, TypeScript, Node.js,
            React, and lately, I've been enjoying exploring Next.js. While I
            initially leaned toward backend development, I currently feel more
            comfortable on the frontend â€” though I believe that understanding
            both sides is essential to building great products and collaborating
            effectively.

            I love designing interfaces and solving problems, especially when I
            can do it with someone else â€” teamwork inspires me and sparks new
            ideas. I'm constantly learning, researching, asking questions when
            needed, and always trying to enjoy the journey, even when things get
            tough.

            Right now, Iâ€™m focused on entering the world of app development and
            Iâ€™m ready to take the leap into the tech industry. I'm still
            figuring out what sets me apart, but I know I want to build things
            that matter. ðŸš€
